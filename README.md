# ASP.NET-Core-5-and-React

My very first ASP.Net Core 5.0 with ReactJS called Ticketing System.

This project is created using a decoupled `ASP.NET Core 5` (Backend) and `ReactJS` (Frontend). For frontend, is using Typescript language and for the UI/UX design is using Material-UI (<https://material-ui.com/>).

## Frontend

1. Created using `create-react-app` with Typescript

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

2. For Material-UI set-up, need to follow the instructions in <https://material-ui.com/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/#option-2>.
